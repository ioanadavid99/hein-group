# hein-group
Python scripts, GUIs and CAD files as part of my co-op with the Hein Group. I used **AutoDesk Inventor** to create the custom robot attachments and **PyCharm** to code the python scripts for automation. I made the GUI using an editor.  

I learned valuable debugging and design skills during my co-op with the Hein Group, and ultimately led me to pursue embedded systems. I had also started drafting a PCB schematic using **KiCad** for an Arduino Uno prior to leaving.
